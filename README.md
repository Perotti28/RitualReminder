# RitualReminder
A python script that reads the client.txt file of Path of exile and alerts users when they interact with a Ritual in the game via a lightweight tkinter gui popup.

For selecting your client file:
For Steam Users:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Path of Exile\logs\
is where you'd find your Client.txt file if you defaulted to normal pathing when downloading

For Standalone (pathofexile.com downloader) client file:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs
is where you'd find your Client.txt file if you defaulted to normal pathing when downloading

For now, after initial launch of the script, close it and reopen it to begin working... I'm working on that.



Disclaimer: This is my first programming project, and I will work on it when I have time to. Apologies for any delays.

#Mapwatch has added a ritual reminder after I brought to light "FindClosestObject" was being inserted into the client.txt, I highly recommend using his app/tool as it has many useful other functions! https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch

If you would like to change the location of your popup you can open the RitualReminderPopSettings.ini while the script is not running and type new locations yourself, or delete that settings file and then run the script.
