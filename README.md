For selecting your client file:
For Steam Users:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Path of Exile\logs\
is where you'd find your Client.txt file if you defaulted to normal pathing when downloading

For Standalone (pathofexile.com downloader) client file:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs
is where you'd find your Client.txt file if you defaulted to normal pathing when downloading




Disclaimer: This is my first programming project, and I will work on it when I have time to. Apologies for any delays.

#Mapwatch has added a ritual reminder after I brought to light "FindClosestObject" was being inserted into the client.txt, I highly recommend using his app/tool as it has many useful other functions! https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch
